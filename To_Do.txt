TO DO

	- Revise the whole output structure --> do something similar to the Folly database (1 folder per cave, for each cave, 1 folder with data, 1 folder with coordinates, 1 folder with Outputs, 1 cave-maps.th file, 1 cave-tot.th file)
	- Add better cave.thconfig file or remove it, it can be accessed with https://github.com/robertxa/Th-Config-Xav
	- Test all the different possibilities
	- Ameliorate the setup.py (https://twidi.github.io/python-packaging-talk/fr) ?
	- requested by a user: conversion from Therion to Tro (but this is quite unproductive...); I will probably not do it
	- Revise the call to the write_thconfig function: for the moment, it does nto take in account the name of the cave defined by the .tro file or the user
